# Pre-processing of bulk RNA-seq data {#Preprocessing}

## Read Mapping
### STAR
STAR is one of the most common tools used for bulk RNA-seq data alignment,which can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR </a>. A tutorial of runing **STAR** is available at <a href="https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-O2/lessons/03_alignment.html">tutorial</a>. \
Once you have installed **STAR**, the first step is to create genome index. in our RIMA pipeline, we download the human genome (hg38) STAR index from <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/">Genomic Data Commons (GDC) </a>.
