# About this tutorial

This is a tutorial about integrative computing analysis of **tumor immunity** using bulk RNA-seq data. We will focus on the inferring the immune infiltration, immune repertoire, immune response and neoantigen prediction from gene expression profile.\
We developed a RNA-seq immune analysis pipeline named **RIMA** that is available at https://github.com/liulab-dfci/RIMA/.
